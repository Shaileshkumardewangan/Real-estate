        <h3>What is a project plan?</h3>
        A project plan, also known as a work plan, is a blueprint of your project lifecycle. It’s like a roadmap — it clearly outlines how to get from where you are now (the beginning of the project) to where you want to go (the successful completion of the project).
        <br><br>
        A comprehensive project plan includes the project schedule, project scope, due dates, and deliverables. Writing a good project plan is key for any new, complex project in the pipeline.
        <h2>Residential :</h2>
        <p>In real estate, "residential" refers to properties intended for people to live in. This can include a wide variety of types, such as single-family homes, condominiums, townhouses, apartments, and duplexes. A residential real estate company specializes in these types of properties, focusing on buying, selling, and renting homes and apartments.
        </p>
        <p>These companies might handle everything from helping buyers find their ideal home to managing rental properties for landlords. Their services could also include providing market analysis, handling transactions, and offering guidance on financing options. Essentially, if you're dealing with properties where people live, that's where a residential real estate company comes into play.</p>
        <p>The 7 steps of planning process in management includes defining project scopes, stakeholder engagement, setting achievable goals, effective planning, task delegation, project execution, and insightful evaluation. Master these steps to streamline your project process, ensuring efficiency and success.</p>

        <h2>Commercial : </h2>
        <p>In real estate, "commercial" refers to properties used primarily for business purposes rather than residential living. This sector of real estate includes a variety of property types, such as:
        </p>
        <p>- *Office Buildings*: Spaces used for business operations, ranging from small office suites to large skyscrapers.<br>
            - *Retail Properties*: Stores, shopping centers, and malls where businesses sell goods and services.<br>
            - *Industrial Properties*: Warehouses, factories, and distribution centers used for manufacturing, storage, and logistics.<br>
            - *Mixed-Use Properties*: Buildings that combine commercial and residential spaces, such as a building with retail on the ground floor and apartments above.<br>
            - *Hospitality Properties*: Hotels, motels, and other properties related to the accommodation industry.
            </p>
            <p>A commercial real estate company specializes in these types of properties, handling activities such as leasing, buying, selling, and managing commercial spaces. They often work with business clients, investors, and developers, providing services like market analysis, property valuation, and investment advice.</p>
